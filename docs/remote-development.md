# Developing tobcalc using Github Codespaces

To simplify development, a `devcontainer.json` file is configured, which allows you to easily start a fully functional development environment within your browser using a [GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces). This environment is useful if you want to make a contribution to the project without having to install all the necessary dependencies on your local machine.

## First launch

It takes roughly 3 minutes to create the codespace and install all necessary dependencies. Once the codespace is ready, the live reload server should automatically start and you should be able to access it through the link that is displayed in the VS Code interface.
